def solve_suvat(s=None, u=None, v=None, a=None, t=None):
    """
    Solves the SUVAT equations for uniformly accelerated motion using symbolic computation (SymPy).

    SUVAT equations relate the following five variables in uniformly accelerated motion:
        - s: displacement
        - u: initial velocity
        - v: final velocity
        - a: acceleration
        - t: time

    You must provide **exactly three known values**, and the function will compute the remaining two.

    Parameters:
        s (float or None): Displacement (in meters). Optional.
        u (float or None): Initial velocity (in m/s). Optional.
        v (float or None): Final velocity (in m/s). Optional.
        a (float or None): Acceleration (in m/s²). Optional.
        t (float or None): Time (in seconds). Optional.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing all five variables {'s': float, 'u': float, 'v': float, 'a': float, 't': float},
              with computed values filled in for the ones that were originally unspecified.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If not exactly three values are provided.
        ValueError: If the system of equations cannot be solved (e.g., inconsistent or unsolvable values).

    Notes:
        - This function uses three standard SUVAT equations:
            1. v = u + at
            2. s = ut + (1/2)at²
            3. v² = u² + 2as
        - The function uses SymPy to solve these equations symbolically.
        - If multiple solutions exist (e.g., time t could be positive or negative), the function selects the positive value if applicable.
        - All returned values are converted to floats.

    Example:
        >>> solve_suvat(u=0, a=2, t=3)
        {'s': 9.0, 'u': 0.0, 'v': 6.0, 'a': 2.0, 't': 3.0}
